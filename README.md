# Neural Networks

## Overview

A repository containing four neural network projects. The projects helped me build my understanding of different neural network architectures and training techniques.


## Projects

### 1. Numpy Neural Network

The first project is a simple neural network built with Numpy designed to learn a non-linear decision boundary between 2D data points.

### 2. MNIST CNN

The second project is a convolutional neural network for MNIST handwritten digit classification built with PyTorch.

### 3. MNIST CNN-LSTM

The third project is a CNN-LSTM model for MNIST sequence prediction built with PyTorch.

### 4. Fashion MNIST VAE and GAN

The fourth project is a VAE and GAN for Fashion MNIST image generation built with PyTorch.
